1- Introduction
---------------

This a script that saves me a lot of time. Its main purpose
is to transfer one file at a time from its small database.

For instance, imagine that you have a tool like rtorrent 
that downloads periodically football matchs of your favourite team. 
After the file is completed, you would run this small script with 
the name of the file and after a while you will have.

2- Dependences
--------------

In order to work, it needs sqlite3 installed.

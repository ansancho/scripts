##  filemon.py
### Explanation

The main purpose of this script is monitoring changes of a file passed as an argument and send
a notification to the user by mail. 

I mainly use it to monitor the views of my curriculum by companies.


In order for filemon works you will need to install watchdog module. Either 
you install it with pip pip install watchdog or with distro tools dnf install python-watchdog.
